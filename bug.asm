mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as ebx + esi*4 + 0x10.  The problem is that esi might not be a multiple of 4, making the memory access unaligned.  Many CPUs will throw an exception for unaligned memory accesses, leading to a crash or unexpected behavior.
